1. First, let's look at how observations are uniquely identified:

When you insert a new observation, the database automatically creates a unique ID. For example:

```sql
-- When you insert a new observation
INSERT INTO observations (object_name, observation_date, source_portal) 
VALUES ('Star123', '2024-03-21', 'MyPortal');
```

This creates a record like:
```
observations table:
id | object_name | observation_date | source_portal
1  | Star123    | 2024-03-21      | MyPortal
2  | Star123    | 2024-03-22      | MyPortal
3  | Star456    | 2024-03-21      | MyPortal
```

2. Then, when you add light curve data, you reference this ID:

```sql
-- Adding light curve points for observation id 1
INSERT INTO light_curves (observation_id, time, flux) 
VALUES 
(1, 0.000, 1.023),
(1, 0.001, 1.025),
...
```

3. To find specific observations, you can query in several ways:

```sql
-- Find all observations of a specific object
SELECT * FROM observations 
WHERE object_name = 'Star123';

-- Find observations on a specific date
SELECT * FROM observations 
WHERE observation_date = '2024-03-21';

-- Find observations of a specific object on a specific date
SELECT * FROM observations 
WHERE object_name = 'Star123' 
AND observation_date = '2024-03-21';
```

4. To get the light curve data for a specific observation:

```sql
-- Get complete light curve for Star123 observed on 2024-03-21
SELECT lc.time, lc.flux 
FROM light_curves lc
JOIN observations o ON lc.observation_id = o.id
WHERE o.object_name = 'Star123' 
AND o.observation_date = '2024-03-21';
```

Here's a practical example:

Let's say you have three observations:
1. Star123 observed on March 21
2. Star123 observed on March 22 (different night)
3. Star456 observed on March 21

The database would look like this:

```
observations table:
id | object_name | observation_date | source_portal
1  | Star123    | 2024-03-21      | MyPortal
2  | Star123    | 2024-03-22      | MyPortal
3  | Star456    | 2024-03-21      | MyPortal

light_curves table:
id | observation_id | time   | flux
1  | 1             | 0.000  | 1.023  -- These belong to Star123 on March 21
2  | 1             | 0.001  | 1.025
3  | 1             | 0.002  | 1.021
...
301| 2             | 0.000  | 0.998  -- These belong to Star123 on March 22
302| 2             | 0.001  | 0.997
...
601| 3             | 0.000  | 1.145  -- These belong to Star456 on March 21
602| 3             | 0.001  | 1.146
```

To get all light curves for Star123:
```sql
SELECT o.observation_date, lc.time, lc.flux 
FROM light_curves lc
JOIN observations o ON lc.observation_id = o.id
WHERE o.object_name = 'Star123'
ORDER BY o.observation_date, lc.time;
```

This would return all measurements for both March 21 and March 22 observations of Star123.

The key points are:
1. Each observation gets a unique ID
2. All light curve points reference this ID through `observation_id`
3. You can search by object name, date, or both
4. The database maintains the relationship between observations and their measurements
5. You can easily distinguish between multiple observations of the same object on different dates

This structure ensures that:
- You never mix up data from different observations
- You can easily find all observations of a particular object
- You can track when each observation was made
- You can store multiple observations of the same object
- You can add metadata about the observation without changing the light curve data structure
